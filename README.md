# MLNNeuralNet

*Under Construction - currently 0.9.1 beta*

MLNNeuralNet is an artificial neural network library that is built in Objective-C. It contains basic methods for matrix-vector arithmetic. This is a stable beta version and currently supports a single hidden layer, with a custom number of inputs & hidden nodes with a single output. Further versions, as well as a Swift 3 port are coming soon(ish).
